Destination variable names can be changed, and arbitrary functions (including indexing) applied, e.g.:\n\n@extract x : q=b a1=abs(a[1]) ai=abs(a[i]) y=max(a[1],b)\n\n# is translated to:\n\nq = x.b\na1 = abs(x.a[1])\nai = abs(x.a[i])\ny = max(x.a[1], x.b)\n\nNotice that the i within the indexing expression is left untouched: indexing is special in this regard.\n\nIn order to explicitly avoid symbol manipulation on the right hand side, use esc(), e.g.:\n\n@extract x : y=abs(a[1] + esc(b))\n\n# is translated to:\n\ny = abs(x.a[1] + b) # b is left untouched\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As mentioned above, since the assignments follow the usual Julia pass-by-reference rules, if you extract a scalar value (e.g. an Int) from a field, and subsequently modify it, the value of the field in the parent object will not be affected.
